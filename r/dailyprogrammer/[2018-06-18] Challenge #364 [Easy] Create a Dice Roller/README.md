### [2018-06-18] Challenge #364 [Easy] Create a Dice Roller

#### Description: 

The first number is the number of dice to roll, the d just means "dice", it's just used to split up the two numbers, and the second number is how many sides the dice have. So the above example of "3d6" means "roll 3 6-sided dice". Also, just in case you didn't know, in D&D, not all the dice we roll are the normal cubes. A d6 is a cube, because it's a 6-sided die, but a d20 has twenty sides, so it looks a lot closer to a ball than a cube.

The first number, the number of dice to roll, can be any integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

The second number, the number of sides of the dice, can be any integer between 2 and 100, inclusive.

#### *BONUS:

In addition to the sum of all dice rolls for your output, print out the result of each roll on the same line
