# üöç Bus Tickets Reservation System using Multithreading

Welcome to the Bus Tickets Reservation System repository! This Java application demonstrates the use of multithreading to manage bus tickets reservations efficiently.

- **Multithreading:** Utilizes Java's multithreading capabilities to handle concurrent bus tickets reservation requests.

## How it Works

The Bus Tickets Reservation System employs a multithreaded approach to handle reservation requests concurrently. Each thread represents a user making a reservation, and the system ensures that multiple users can reserve seats simultaneously without conflicts (or handle those conflicts).

This project does not have any external dependencies. It is written in pure Java, making it easy to run on any platform with Java installed.
